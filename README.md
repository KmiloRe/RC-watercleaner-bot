# RC-watercleaner-bot
Bluetooth controled scale boat designed to remove trash (plastics and alike) from mostly static bodies of water

Electronic Components
esp8266 (Just like an arduino uno but better, smaller and cheaper)
L298 (Controls 2 engines)
HC-06 (bluetooth module, though the esp8266 can be controled through a web page)

For control, just download Arduino bluetooth controler from the playstore and configure the buttons according to the movement u want (a to advance, r for reverse, i for left and d for right, donÂ´t forget s for stop)
